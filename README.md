# internet-directory-listing
Used to exist, deleted it, but now bringing it back because it'll now have empty files where files should be rather than just folders.
I cannot guarantee that all links listed here are available at this time, you will have to try them to find out.
If you found a link that works and isn't in there, link it in the issues tab.

P.S. the 3-letter thing is the main part of the name (ex. download.windowsupdate.com can be found in w/i/n/download.windowsupdate.com)
