# internet-directory-listing
Edit: [Moved to GDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1P_AX5DNYJYwb5MqYerY7nfsKWPX4reDA), but the "If you found a link that works and isn't in there, link it in the issues tab" will still happen that way

Used to exist, deleted it, but now bringing it back because it'll now have empty files where files should be rather than just folders.
I cannot guarantee that all links listed here are available at this time, you will have to try them to find out.
If you found a link that works and isn't in there, link it in the issues tab.

P.S. the 3-letter thing is the main part of the name (ex. download.windowsupdate.com can be found in w/i/n/download.windowsupdate.com)
